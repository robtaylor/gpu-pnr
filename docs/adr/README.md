# Architecture Decision Records

Numbered records of non-obvious design choices, kept forever, amended in place
when scope expands, never deleted.

For the full convention, see
[Claude Project Discipline — ADRs](https://robtaylor.github.io/claude-project-discipline/adr.html).

## Format

See [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md). Status lifecycle:

```
Proposed → Accepted (YYYY-MM-DD) → [Superseded by ADR MMMM | Withdrawn]
```

When scope expands, amend the Status line in place rather than rewriting:

```
**Status:** Accepted (2026-05-11). Scope expanded 2026-08-01 — see Decision §3.
```

When superseded, update Status on the old ADR and add a new ADR that references
it. Never delete the old one.
