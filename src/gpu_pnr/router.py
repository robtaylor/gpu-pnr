"""Sequential multi-net routing on 2D and 3D (multi-layer) grids.

Reserves all pin cells (sources + sinks of every net) as obstacles before
routing starts; temporarily un-reserves a net's own pins while it routes.
This stops earlier nets from running their wires through later nets'
pins, which would otherwise force the later nets to fail.

A net's path cells (including its endpoints, which become wires once
routed) are committed to a separate `routed_cells` set. Once a cell is
in that set we never un-reserve it -- two nets touching the same wire
would be an electrical short.

The 3D variant treats (layer, row, col) as the cell coordinate; pins on
different layers at the same (row, col) are distinct cells.
